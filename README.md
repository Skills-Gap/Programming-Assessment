# Introduction

While not a very new or novel problem, this assessment is designed to provide us with an understanding of your thought processes relating to programming _without_ introducing artificial constraints on language or knowledge domain. The instructions contained within are language-agnostic and will require you to:

  1. Understand the problem.
  1. Pseudocode your solution, and
  1. To test and submit your results.

We ask that you refrain from searching for any answers for this assessment. Searching for syntax and functions is, of course, allowed, but plagiarism will be ground for removal from candidacy.

# The Problem

> "Hi! I can't tell you my name right now because I'm working undercover, but I know you're a rockstar technologist who can help me! I'm currently trapped in enemy territory and I need you to transmit this message so that my colleagues will know I'm in trouble. However, this message has to be secure, so this is why I've come to you."

> "I need _someone_ in my government to read this message, and they'll be monitoring Twitter."

> "Can you help me? If so, here's what you need to do:"

> 1. Create an interface to take English input and convert it to non-readable text. Use a character-rotation algorithm, such that if you specify **rot2**, `a=c` and `b=d`. **rot3** would be `a=d` and `z=c`.
> 1. Encode the string as a `base64` string and **rot12**.
> 1. Ensure that your translation matrix works. My life is counting on it!
> 1. Let me know when your work is complete in a private repository on GitHub.

> "The message I need to send is: **The quick brown fox has jumped over the lazy dog.**"

> "Bona fortuna."

> "â€”Agent X"

# The Solution

Using any language of your choice, create a cipher to enable Agent X to send a secret message. The transmitted message will be a simple base64 encoded string, using **rot12**, as provided by Agent X. It is recommended to test your program using various rotations.

Pseudocode is important! Even if you can't get an exact solution, understanding your systematic thinking with pseudocode will help us to evaluate your work.

# Submission

Create a new, private GitHub repository in which to store your code and provide access to `ian-dodd`. Email Ian when completed.
